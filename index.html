                <h4>Seoul</h4>
                <p>
                  “Seoul” is the second track from RM’s second mixtape, mono.
                  With a relaxed backing instrumental, RM displays the wordplay
                  of Seoul, the city he currently lives in, and the word “soul.”
                  He expresses his bittersweet relationship with the
                  metropolitan city. Throughout the lyrics, he challenges how
                  genuine a place built of concrete and systematic mindsets can
                  be.

                    With the cold air of the dawn I secretly open my eyes This
                    city's harmony, it’s so familiar to me The days of my youth
                    seem so far away And now it's full of buildings and cars But
                    this is my home now (Seoul, Seoul)

                  This track -which RM himself has co-written it is a gift from
                  BTS to their fans called ARMY in occasion of Festa -a two week
                  long celebration in honor of BTS debut anniversary. In this
                  song, RM shows how he felt when he was on a bike riding over
                  his hometown during the Covid-19 pandemic, as it goes: …I
                  don’t see no open cars, no open bars It’s not bad, I’m all
                  alone in this road…

                <p>
                  On “들꽃놀이 (Wild Flower)” RM takes a trip to the past, his
                  20s, and discusses the internal struggle between fame and
                  success while staying true to who you are. The song works as
                  the lead single off RM’s first full-length album, Indigo. RM
                  started working on the song in 2019, inviting Cherry Filter’s
                  vocalist, youjeen—his idol and South Korean rock icon—to it.

                    When your feet don't touch the ground When your own heart
                    underestimates you When your dreams devour you When you feel
